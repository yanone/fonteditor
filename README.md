# Counterpunch Font Editor

## Live App

Try the editor live:

- Latest official release (using `release.sh`): https://editor.counterpunch.space
- Latest preview (updated after each succesful push): https://preview.editor.counterpunch.space

## Develop

Run the app locally with `cd webapp && npm run dev`

- Load assistant test conversation with `?assistant_style_test`

### Type Drift Detection

TypeScript types are auto-generated from `babelfont-rs` and must stay in sync. The type drift check runs automatically in `npm test`:

```bash
# Update WASM and types from latest babelfont-rs
./update-rust-deps.sh
./build-fontc-wasm.sh
./regenerate-types.sh

# Verify sync (runs in CI)
./check-type-drift.sh
```

All three components (WASM, types, drift check) lock to the same `babelfont-rs` commit via `Cargo.lock` for version coherence.

## Releasing a New Version

To create and deploy a new release, run the release script from the repository root:

```bash
./release.sh v1.0.0
```

This script automatically:

- Updates the version number in `webapp/coi-serviceworker.js`
- Extracts release notes from the "Unreleased" section in `CHANGELOG.md`
- Commits the version change
- Creates and pushes a git tag
- Triggers GitHub Actions to create a release and deploy to Cloudflare Pages

Users will see an orange update notification button in the title bar within 10 minutes and can reload to get the latest version without manually clearing their cache.
