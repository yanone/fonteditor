# Installing plugins and packages

Python in Counterpunch can grow in two ways. **Plugin Manager** installs Font Destination plugins and keeps their wheels on disk (mor eplugin types coming soon). **`micropip.install()`** adds a plugin wheel or any Pyodide-compatible package for the current session only.

The runtime is still the browser’s Pyodide, not the Python on your computer. A package must be installable there: pure Python, or a wheel published for Pyodide.

## Plugin Manager

Open **Tools → Plugin Manager**. The first time, connect a **Settings Folder** if none is selected. You can also choose the Settings Folder in Settings (`Cmd/Ctrl+,`).

The manager lists Font Destination plugins discovered on GitHub. **Install** downloads the latest release wheel, checks its checksum, and writes it into `Plugins` inside the Settings Folder. **Uninstall** removes that wheel. After a successful install, the destination appears under **Tools → Font Destinations**.

## Saved locally

Installed plugins are `.whl` files in the Settings Folder’s `Plugins` directory. That is the durable copy. After a reload, Counterpunch reinstalls every wheel in that folder into Pyodide so plugins return without using Plugin Manager again.

The Settings Folder is separate from the Files **Disk** project folder. How both are chosen is in [Project and settings folders](../getting-started/04-project-and-settings-folders.md). The same Settings Folder also holds `Scripts` and `Filters`.

## Temporary installs with micropip

In [Konsole](03-konsole-quick-tasks.md) or a script, install a package or a plugin wheel for this session:

```python
import micropip
await micropip.install("fonttools")
```

`await` is required. Use a PyPI name when Pyodide can resolve it, or a URL to a compatible `.whl`. The install lasts until you reload the editor. It is not written to `Plugins` and will not return on the next launch.

Use this to try a plugin without keeping it, or to pull in a complete package for one task. For something you want every session, install it with Plugin Manager (plugins) or copy a compatible wheel into `Plugins`.

`numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `pandas` install themselves the first time a script or Konsole command imports them. You do not need `micropip` for those three.

Python setup is in [Python in Counterpunch](01-python-in-counterpunch.md). Reusable scripts are in [Writing general scripts](04-writing-general-scripts.md).
