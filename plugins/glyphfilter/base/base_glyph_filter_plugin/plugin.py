    Base template for glyph filter plugins.
    
    Glyph filter plugins classify one glyph at a time. The host owns full
    scans, incremental cache updates, glyph lifetime handling, and groups.
    
    Required attributes:
    - path: The category path where this filter appears (must match a registered path)
    - keyword: Unique identifier using reverse domain name (e.g., 'com.example.myfilter')
    - display_name: Human-readable name shown in the sidebar
    
    Required methods:
    - classify_glyph(glyph): Return a classification mapping or None

    Required attributes:
    - event_types: Glyph-content events that can change a classification

    Optional methods:
    - is_candidate(glyph): Cheap early rejection predicate
