    Base template for glyph filter plugins.
    
    Glyph filter plugins define filters that return subsets of glyphs
    with optional group coding. They appear in the glyph overview sidebar.
    
    Required attributes:
    - path: The category path where this filter appears (must match a registered path)
    - keyword: Unique identifier using reverse domain name (e.g., 'com.example.myfilter')
    - display_name: Human-readable name shown in the sidebar
    
    Required methods:
    - get_groups(): Return group definitions for group keywords
    - filter_glyphs(font): Return list of glyphs matching the filter

    Optional attributes:
    - auto_update_events: List of JS event names that should re-run the filter

        Return group definitions for group keywords.
        
        Each group has a keyword key, with a dict containing:
        - description: Human-readable description of what this group means
        - color: Hex color value for visual identification
        
        Example:
            {

                    "description": "Glyphs with errors",

        return {}
    
    def filter_glyphs(self, font):
        """
        Filter glyphs from the font and return results.
        
        This is the main filter method. The font object is passed in as a parameter.
        Should return (or yield) a list of dicts, each containing:
        - glyph_name: Name of the glyph
        - group (optional): A single group keyword (from get_groups) or a raw CSS color
        - groups (optional): A list of group keywords or raw CSS colors
        
        A glyph can belong to multiple groups in two ways:
        1. Using the 'groups' key with a list of keywords
        2. Yielding the same glyph multiple times with different 'group' values
           (results are automatically merged by glyph_name)
        
        Group values can be:
        - A keyword matching a key in get_groups() → uses the defined color
        - A raw CSS color (hex, named, rgb(), etc.) → auto-generates a group for the legend
        
        When filtering by groups in the UI, glyphs will appear if they match ANY of the selected groups.
        
        Args:
            font: The font object (babelfont model)
            
        Example (single group with definition):
            def filter_glyphs(self, font):
                results = []
                for glyph in font.glyphs:
                    if some_condition(glyph):
                        results.append({
                            "glyph_name": glyph.name,
                            "group": "error"  # Must match a key in get_groups()
                        })
                return results
        
        Example (raw colors without group definitions):
            # No GROUPS definition needed - colors become legend entries automatically
            def filter_glyphs(self, font):
                for glyph in font.glyphs:
                    if glyph.name.startswith("A"):
                        yield {"glyph_name": glyph.name, "group": "#ff6600"}
                    elif glyph.name.startswith("B"):
                        yield {"glyph_name": glyph.name, "group": "lightblue"}
        
        Example (multiple groups using 'groups' list):
            def filter_glyphs(self, font):
                results = []
                for glyph in font.glyphs:
                    groups = []
                    if has_error(glyph):
                        groups.append("error")
                    if has_warning(glyph):
                        groups.append("warning")
                    results.append({
                        "glyph_name": glyph.name,
                        "groups": groups  # Can be empty, one, or multiple groups
                    })
                return results
        
        Example (multiple groups via yield - same glyph emitted multiple times):
            def filter_glyphs(self, font):
                for glyph in font.glyphs:
                    if has_error(glyph):
                        yield {"glyph_name": glyph.name, "group": "error"}
                    if has_warning(glyph):
                        yield {"glyph_name": glyph.name, "group": "warning"}
                    # If glyph has both, it will appear once with both groups merged
            
        Returns:
            List of filter result dicts (or generator yielding them)
