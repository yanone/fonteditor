# classify_glyph(glyph) is the mandatory method called once
# per glyph. It should return one of the following:
# Return False to not show a glyph at all.
# Return True to show a glyph without a group.
# Return a groups mapping to show and categorize a glyph.
# 
# is_candidate(glyph) is an optional method that can
# be used to quickly filter out glyphs that cannot match.
# It is called before classify_glyph(glyph)
# and can be used to improve performance for large fonts
# or when the main classify_glyph() method is expensive to compute.

# Example:
# Re-run this filter only when Unicode assignments change.
